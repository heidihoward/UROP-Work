Testing performance of tools for online anonymity

Aims & Objectives

The two types of anonyity that I will be considering are:

- hide identify for web hosts including your locations, IP address, browsing habits, MAC address, facebook username etc..
- hide browsing from man-in-the-middle dispute use of unsecure Wi-Fi e.g. in cafes 

I will evaluate a range of tools for online anonymity aganist the following criteria:
	1. Ease of install
	2. Impact on network performance
	3. Degree to which aims are achieved 
	4. Useability
	5. Side Effects (positive + negative)

Scope

- Consider a range of tools from simple tools such as broswer plugins to more complex solution such as VPN's
- Only consider open source tools that are avaliable on linux or andriod (don't need to consider mac or windows)
- Only use hardware set out below
- Only use the networks set out below

Hardware 

- Laptop (typically as a client) running Ubuntu 12.04
- Desktop (typically as a server) running Ubuntu 12.04 
- Raspberry pi
- Andriod Phone 

Avaliable Networks

- College ethenet (possible issues with the firewall/NAT) (typically for the server)
- wgb Wi-Fi (typically for the client)
- Lapwing (typically for the client)
- Eduroam (typically for the cleint)
- 3G (possiblity for the android phone)

Software/ Unix Command line Tools

- Tor browser bundle (for qualative analysis)
- Tor in commond line (for quantative analysis)
- Firefox browser + plugins
- Traceroute ??
- Wireshark ??
- iperf
- openVPN
- Privoxy
- dig / host
- Octave (to analysis quantative results)
- Hamachi
- Freedom Box
- Orbot (Tor for andoid)
- CyanogenMod
- Iodine ?

Qualative Results

- Description on tools against the evalation criteria 
- Description of install process via command line
- Reasearch into the level of anonymity provided

Quantative Results

-Data on network performance of tools includes features such as bandwidth, latency, packet loss and jitter

Tools to Test 

- Tor
- Privoxy
- FreedomBox
- Firefox Addons

etc..
