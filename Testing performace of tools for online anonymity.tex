\section{Aims and Objectives}

\subsection{Types of Anonymity}
The two types of anonymity that I will be considering are:

- hide identify for web hosts including your locations, IP address, browsing habits, MAC address, facebook username etc..
- hide browsing from man-in-the-middle dispute use of unsecure Wi-Fi e.g. in cafes 

\subsection{Difference between Anonymity and Security}

\subsection{Evaluation Criteria for Anonymity Tools}
I will evaluate a range of tools for online anonymity aganist the following criteria:
	1. Ease of install
	2. Impact on network performance
	3. Degree to which aims are achieved 
	4. Useability
	5. Side Effects (positive + negative)


\section{Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a range of tools from simple tools such as broswer plugins to more complex solution such as VPN's
\item Only consider open source tools that are avaliable on linux or andriod (don't need to consider mac or windows)
\item Only use hardware set out below
\item Only use the networks set out below
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware} 

\subsection{Laptop (typically as a client) running Ubuntu 12.04}
\subsection{Desktop (typically as a server) running Ubuntu 12.04}
\subsection{Raspberry pi}
\subsection{Andriod Phone} 

\section{Avaliable Networks}

\subsection{College ethenet (possible issues with the firewall/NAT) (typically for the server)}
\subsection{wgb Wi-Fi (typically for the client)}
\subsection{Lapwing (typically for the client)}
\subsection{Eduroam (typically for the cleint)}
\subsection{3G (possiblity for the android phone)}

\section{Software/ Unix Command line Tools}

\subsection{Tor browser bundle (for qualative analysis)}
\subsection{Tor in commond line (for quantative analysis)}
\subsection{Firefox browser + plugins}
\subsection{Traceroute ??}
\subsection{Wireshark ??}
\subsection{iperf}
\subsection{openVPN}
\subsection{Privoxy}
\subsection{dig / host}
\subsection{Octave (to analysis quantative results)}
\subsection{Hamachi}
\subsection{Freedom Box}
\subsection{Orbot (Tor for andoid)}
\subsection{CyanogenMod}
\subsection{odine ?}

\section{Tools to Test} 
- 
\subsection{Tor}
\subsection{Privoxy}
\subsection{FreedomBox}
\subsection{Firefox Addons}

etc..

\section{Qualative Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Description on tools against the evalation criteria 
\item Description of install process via command line
\item Reasearch into the level of anonymity provided
\end{itemize}


\section{Quantative Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data on network performance of tools includes features such as bandwidth, latency, packet loss and jitter
\end{itemize}
